## Image Processing - Image Inversion

This repository contains the implementation of an image inversion algorithm using Verilog. The image inversion process involves flipping the color values of the pixels in an image, resulting in a negative version of the original image. This can be particularly useful in various image processing applications and analysis.

### Repository Structure

The repository includes the following files:

1. **Verilog Files**
   - `top.v`: The top-level module for the image inversion algorithm. It integrates all the other modules and defines the overall structure of the design.
   - `tb.v`: The testbench for verifying the functionality of the image inversion algorithm. It provides the necessary stimuli and checks the output against expected results.
   - `controller.v`: The controller module responsible for managing the data flow and control signals between the various components of the design.
   - `cov_inversion.v`: The core module that performs the actual image inversion. It processes the input image data and produces the inverted output.
   - `rowbuffer.v`: The row buffer module used for temporarily storing rows of image data during processing.

2. **Image Files**
   - Input image file(s): The original image(s) to be processed. These files should be in a compatible format that the Verilog modules can read.
   - Output image file(s): The resulting image(s) after the inversion process. These files will be generated by the simulation and stored for comparison with the input images.

### How to Use

1. **Upload the Verilog Files**: Ensure that all the Verilog files (`top.v`, `tb.v`, `controller.v`, `cov_inversion.v`, `rowbuffer.v`) are uploaded to the repository.

2. **Upload the Input Image File**: Provide the input image file(s) that you want to process. The image should be in a compatible format that the Verilog modules can read.

3. **Run the Simulation**: Use a Verilog simulator to run the testbench (`tb.v`). The simulation will process the input image and generate the inverted output image.

4. **Output Image**: The output image file(s) will be generated and stored. You can compare the output image with the input image to verify the inversion process.


4. **Check Output**:
   After the simulation completes, check the generated output image file(s) and compare them with the input image to verify the inversion process.
